# URL Standards

URLs are a highly visible attribute of your content that impacts user experience, accessibility, and search rankings.  The URL of a page specifies the page's name and location within VA.gov. 

## About URLs
- URLs consists of a domain, sub-directories (optional), and a page name.  
- A good URL helps users AND search engines by providing: 
  - A high-level description of what the content is about
  - The location of the content within your site 
  - An indication of the priority of the content based on the depth (i.e. number of sub-directories in the URL path) of the content
  - Information about how the content is related to other content within your site.

# URL Guidelines

The URL path is the component of the URL that immediately follows the domain (i.e. www.va.gov) and directs the user to a specific file, or, page on the site. 
* The path is made up of 1 or more directories, depending on how deep the page is within the site.

* The full path is primarily determined by the location of the file within the structure of the site – the information architecture.  
* The last component - or the file name – should be determined based on the primary topic of the page and SEO keywords. 


### Process/Governance

The URLs are primarily determined by the IA of the site and keyword identification.  

If your project requires the creation of a new content page, form/application or online tool, loop in IA on the project in the early phases for awareness and background.  The IA can also help to identify structural, navigational or labeling considerations early in the process.  

Typical steps in determining a new URL:

1.	Define the IA
   * The IA determines where in the structure the page will live and defines the path of the URL.
   *	This process can, on occasion, require some user research, depending on the extent of the change.  Research methods may include card sorting, tree testing or user interviews. 
2.	Define the Page Name
   * Collaboration between the IA, product and content team to determine page title.
   * Identification of SEO keywords
   *	This info will inform the labeling for the file name in the URL path.
3.	Define the Linking Strategy
    *	Collaboration between IA and product/project team to determine how users will link to the new page.  
    *	Will item live in the primary navigation of the site?
    *	Where are all the entry points to the new page?
  *	This work can be done after the URL is determined, but can sometimes impact the original decision.
  
### Guidelines/Best Practices

  *	Use the page title as your guide, but you do not need to match it exactly.
  *	Use the most descriptive of all the keywords used on the page. Include only keywords that help the reader understand the point of the page.
  * Do not load or repeat keywords in the URL, the search engines will pick up other keywords in the full URL and other elements on the page.  
  *	Don’t include words that don’t add meaning, such as “the” or “a.”
  * Review similar pages on the site for naming consistency. 
  *	Avoid repetition of words. In some cases it may naturally happen, but avoid where possible.
  *	URLs should be all lowercase.
  *	Use hyphens, not underscores. (Underscoring can change two words into one word, so “health care” becomes “healthcare.”)
  *	Keep folder/file names as short as possible without losing the meaning. 
 
 ### Standard URL Formats
 
 For forms, use both the form number, as well as keywords from the form name.
 – /form-1234-keywords-from-form-name
 – 	Example:  https://www.vets.gov/pension/application/form-527EZ-veteran-pension   (This example is not live)
  
  More standards will be added as they are identified.

A vanity URL is a short, simple, memorable and readable URL that utilizes the existing domain (va.gov) and redirects users to a specific page of the va.gov site.  

** Example: ** www.va.gov/vre takes users to https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/ 


A “shortened URL” is a short, simple URL, but is generally made up of a randomized set of characters. VA does not currently provide a URL shortener service, so any external shortener services will not utilize the va.gov domain. 

**Example:** http://go.usa.gov/TBUj takes users to https://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Environment-Agriculture.shtml

### Vanity URLs ###

The structure of a vanity URL is the va.gov domain plus a keyword segment -  www.va.gov/[keyword] 

We do not use sub-domains for vanity urls (i.e. education.va.gov) 
We do not use custom top-level domains for vanity urls (i.e. www.va.apply) 

### When to use a vanity URL ###

To provide a short and memorable URL for high profile content or tools on va.gov that lives 3 or more levels deep or has a URL with 70 or more characters. 

To provide an easy to remember and speak/type URL for a campaign landing page.

### When not to use a vanity URL: ###
* For links to content that exists external to va.gov.
* For links to files or documents such as a pdf.
* For links to content or tools that live within the top 1-2 levels of the site already (i.e. www.va.gov/health-care). 
* For links to content in the Resources and Support area of the site.
* To create an acronym or abbreviation, or to use one that is not well known by Veterans.

### Guidance for choosing a vanity URL ###

* Vanity URLs must be easy to say and type, as they are often used in print, video and audio campaigns where users have to understand, remember and then enter them into their browser.
* Do users need to change keyboards on a mobile device to enter the vanity URL (i.e. switching between alpha and numeric character keyboards)?
* Can assisted tech users easily speak the URL?
* The vanity URLs should send users to content that matches the meaning and specificity of the keywords used in the URL.
* You must follow the core URL standards when determining your vanity URL, to ensure it is  unique, accurate, readable and properly formatted.
